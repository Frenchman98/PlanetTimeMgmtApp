# Planet Time Management/Calculation App
Developed for free for [Newport Corporation](https://www.newport.com/)

###
Currently on first version. Missing functionality is:
- Tabs 2 & 3
- Time calculation (other than machine time) in table

Waiting on response from Newport Corporation on functionality that they would like to see implemented, or removed, to continue with development.

Developed with expansion in mind, so expanding from 1 to 3 tabs (or more) should require minimal modifications to code, most of which are already labeled as todo items. Also, optimization was not the focus, simply functionality, since it is a relatively small application. There is one big mistake I made in terms of development, which is not storing planets within the machines, but I only thought of this after having written most of the code.
